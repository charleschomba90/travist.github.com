If there is one JavaScript library that could be classified as the Swiss Army Knives of JavaScript, it would have to be
[Lodash](https://lodash.com/). Lodash is a tool that I use all the time in pretty much every single JavaScript project
that I write, and I constantly find myself going to the website to read the documentation. If there is one thing that I
wish I could do, however, it test my Lodash code within a JavaScript console before I place that within my code. It is this
reason that I created an [Online Lodash Tester](https://codepen.io/travist/full/jrBjBz/) within [Codepen](https://codepen.io).

Enjoy!
