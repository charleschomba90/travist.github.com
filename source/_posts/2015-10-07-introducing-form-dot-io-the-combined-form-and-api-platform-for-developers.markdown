I am very excited to talk to you about a new project that I have been working on called <a target="_blank" href="https://form.io">&lt;form.io&gt;</a>. As a quick introduction, Form.io is the first combined Form and API platform built specifically for Developers. It provides them an easy to use drag-and-drop form builder interface that not only creates forms that can be embedded within their applications, but also automatically generates a RESTful API to support them. Take a look at this 2 minute video to get a better idea of this amazing technology, and enjoy Form.io!
