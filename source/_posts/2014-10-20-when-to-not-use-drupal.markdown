Today, I gave a presentation to the Drupal Dallas meetup over when to NOT use
Drupal.  This is in many ways a hard topic to discuss, since as a Drupal fan,
I want Drupal to be the solution to many web problems. However, it just isn't
pragmatic in many cases, and the presentation I gave explores this topic.

In short, my challenge is for everyone to stop saying "Yeah, Drupal can do that!"
and instead start saying "Yeah, Drupal SHOULD do that!" and mean it.

I hope you enjoy.
