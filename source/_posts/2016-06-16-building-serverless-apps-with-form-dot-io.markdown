Since we released [Form.io](https://form.io) last year, we have come a long way to provide a revolutionary new tool that catapults developers to world of Serverless Applications. In this walkthrough tutorial, I show you how to build a Serverless Movie Management application where you can create Playlists of Movie Trailers from YouTube. We also talk about the concepts behind Serverless applications, and then end up revealing an amazing capability that allows developers to share, fork, and launch existing apps on Github. Enjoy!
